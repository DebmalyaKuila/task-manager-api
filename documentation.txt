##problems to fix:
1.when i find a resource by id , if i use an invalid if ,there,s some issue-
    i.if the length of id is less than or greaten than the actual mongodb object id size , i get a 500 beacause
     mongoose findById promise  is falling to catch as it's trated as an error
             "name": "CastError"
        note-app is not crashing
    ii.if I enter an invalid id of same length as pf original monbodb objectid ,I get a 404 which is fine ,
    thats how I have set it up. BUT, when after firing that request from postman, the node app crashes with error
            Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
        note-app is crashed
2.some issues during updating -
    i.patch with invalid id , the whole app crashes
